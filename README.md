# Hi! Iâ€™m Rafael :thumbsup:

I'm a Geographer, specialist in geoprocessing, passionate about technology, design and business. Constantly learning, curious, methodical and creative. I believe that data should guide decisions and solutions need to be created with the user experience in mind.

> I'm currently in a career transition to the IT area as a web application developer. My goal is to combine my knowledge and experience in geotechnologies in the implementation of WebGis solutions, such as mapping, routing, geomarketing, among others...
